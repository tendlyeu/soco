# Deep.ist — Marketing Strategy

## Product Summary

**Deep** (deep.ist) is a monthly subscription box delivering physical exploration workbooks for intellectually curious children aged 6–12.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary: Parents of gifted / intellectually curious children (ages 6–12)

- Parent is typically 30–45, educated, dual-income household
- Child reads above grade level, gets bored at school, asks "why" questions constantly
- Parent already searches for "gifted enrichment," "challenging activities for smart kids," "beyond school worksheets"
- Lives in the Netherlands (current shipping) or English-speaking EU expat communities
- Values screen-free, independent learning
- Willing to spend €29/mo on education — similar to a single after-school activity

### Secondary: Primary school teachers (enrichment & differentiation)

- Looking for ready-to-use independent work for advanced learners
- Buys via school budgets or recommends to parents
- Found via teacher communities, education conferences, gifted-education networks

### Tertiary: Grandparents & gift-givers

- Searching for meaningful, recurring gift for a grandchild/niece/nephew
- Peak season: birthdays, Christmas, back-to-school

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Difference from Deep |
|---|---|
| KiwiCo / Tinker Crate | Hands-on STEM kits, more craft than intellectual depth |
| MEL Science | Lab experiments, narrowly science-focused |
| Brilliant.org (kids) | App-based, screen time |
| Kumon / worksheets | Drill-based, not open-ended |
| Local enrichment classes | Scheduled, location-dependent, expensive |

**Deep's moat:** Physical, personalised, open-ended thinking workbooks that adapt to the child's level based on feedback — no screen, no drill, no schedule.

## Channel Strategy

### 1. Organic Search (SEO) — Long-term foundation

**Target keywords (by intent):**

| Intent | Keywords |
|---|---|
| Problem-aware | "my child is bored at school," "gifted child enrichment," "challenging activities for smart kids" |
| Solution-aware | "subscription box for gifted kids," "science workbook subscription," "monthly education box" |
| Product-aware | "deep explorations review," "deep.ist subscription" |

**Content to create:**

- **Blog on Shopify** (5–8 pillar articles):
  - "What to do when your gifted child is bored at school"
  - "Screen-free learning: why physical workbooks still matter"
  - "How open-ended questions develop critical thinking in children"
  - "Enrichment vs acceleration: what gifted kids actually need"
  - "How to choose the right reading level for your child"
- **Each exploration topic as a teaser page** (e.g., "What is gravity? — A Deep Exploration for curious kids") — these rank for long-tail science queries parents search with their children
- **FAQ / comparison pages**: "Deep vs KiwiCo," "Deep vs Kumon"

**Technical SEO:**
- Add structured data (Product, SubscriptionOffer, Review schema)
- Improve page titles — current titles are generic ("Deep", "Subscription – Deep")
- Add meta descriptions to all pages
- Create XML sitemap entries for blog content

### 2. Paid Social — Fastest path to subscribers

**Platform priority:** Meta (Instagram + Facebook) > Pinterest > Google Ads

**Meta Ads strategy:**

- **Campaign 1 — Problem/emotion (TOF)**
  - Hook: "Your child finishes schoolwork in 10 minutes and spends the rest of the day bored."
  - Creative: Short video of a child flipping through a Deep workbook, thinking, drawing, writing
  - Audience: Parents 30–45, interests in gifted education, Montessori, homeschooling, children's books, educational toys
  - Geo: Netherlands (expand to Belgium/Germany when shipping allows)
  - CTA: Learn more → landing page

- **Campaign 2 — Product demo (MOF)**
  - Hook: "One big question. One month of deep thinking."
  - Creative: Carousel showing 4 reading levels of the same topic, close-ups of personalised cover
  - Retarget: Website visitors, email subscribers, video viewers (75%+)
  - CTA: Subscribe → product page

- **Campaign 3 — Social proof / UGC (BOF)**
  - Hook: "My daughter asked to keep working on it after bedtime."
  - Creative: Parent testimonials, child reactions, unboxing
  - Retarget: Add-to-cart abandoners, returning visitors
  - CTA: Subscribe now

**Budget guidance:** Start at €20–30/day, test 3–5 ad variants per campaign, optimise toward purchase events. Target CAC under €35 (pays back in ~2 months given 4+ month average retention for subscription boxes).

**Pinterest:**
- Pin each exploration topic visually ("What if gravity changed?" with illustration)
- Target: parents searching "educational activities," "gifted kids activities," "science for kids"
- Pinterest is high-intent for this category — parents actively pin educational ideas

### 3. Email Marketing — Retention & conversion engine

**List building:**
- Homepage email signup already exists ("Join our community") — good
- Add a **lead magnet**: free downloadable "Mini Deep Exploration" (1 topic, shortened) in exchange for email
- Add exit-intent popup on product page with the lead magnet offer

**Sequences:**

| Sequence | Trigger | Emails | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Welcome | Email signup | 5 emails over 10 days | Convert to subscriber |
| Abandoned cart | Cart created, no purchase in 2h | 3 emails over 3 days | Recover sale |
| Monthly teaser | 5 days before next shipment | 1 email | Build anticipation, reduce churn |
| Feedback loop | 2 weeks after delivery | 1 email | Collect child feedback, testimonials |
| Win-back | Cancelled 30 days ago | 2 emails | Re-subscribe with offer |
| Referral ask | After 3rd delivery | 1 email | Trigger word-of-mouth |

**Welcome sequence detail:**
1. Day 0: "Welcome — here's your free Mini Exploration" (deliver lead magnet)
2. Day 2: "Why we built Deep" (founder story — Oxford, gifted child, frustration with shallow activities)
3. Day 4: "What parents say" (testimonials, child reactions)
4. Day 7: "See a full Deep Exploration" (link to sample PDF, reading level quiz)
5. Day 10: "Ready to start? First month ships this week" (subscribe CTA, urgency)

### 4. Community & Word-of-Mouth — Highest-LTV channel

**Referral programme:**
- "Give €10, get €10" — existing subscriber shares a link, friend gets €10 off first month, referrer gets €10 credit
- Implement via Shopify referral app (e.g., ReferralCandy, Yotpo)

**Parent communities (Netherlands-focused):**
- Facebook groups: "Hoogbegaafde kinderen" (gifted children NL), expat parent groups
- Reddit: r/giftedkids, r/parenting, r/Netherlands (organic, helpful posts — not spam)
- Local: gifted education associations (e.g., Pharos, SLO Talentontwikkeling)

**Teacher outreach:**
- Offer a free "Teacher Trial Pack" (1 exploration + classroom guide)
- Partner with gifted education coordinators at Dutch primary schools
- Present at education conferences (e.g., ECHA — European Council for High Ability)

### 5. Content Marketing & Social Media — Brand building

**Instagram** (primary social channel):
- 3–4 posts/week: mix of child work samples, exploration previews, parent tips, behind-the-scenes
- Reels: "Watch a child explore [topic]" — 30-60s, authentic, not polished
- Stories: polls ("Which topic next?"), Q&A with founders, delivery day unboxing

**LinkedIn** (founder-led):
- Artur's profile: 1–2 posts/week on gifted education, building Deep, lessons from Teach For All
- Goal: build credibility, attract advisors, partnerships, press

**YouTube** (low-effort, high-impact):
- Monthly "Inside this Deep Exploration" video (2–3 min): founder walks through the workbook
- Doubles as ad creative and email content

## Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO)

### Website improvements (high-impact, low-effort)

1. **Add social proof to homepage**: testimonial quotes, number of subscribers, star ratings
2. **Show the product earlier**: the first product card appears below the fold — move a "Subscribe now" CTA + product image above the fold
3. **Add a "How it works" summary on the product page** (currently only on a separate page)
4. **Reading level quiz**: interactive widget — "Answer 3 questions about your child's reading → we recommend a level" — reduces friction at checkout
5. **Urgency/scarcity on product page**: "Order by [date] to receive this month's exploration: [topic name]"
6. **Improve product page title tags**: "Deep Explorations — Monthly Science Workbook for Curious Kids (Ages 6–12)"
7. **Add a hero video**: 60-second overview showing a child working through an exploration
8. **Mobile optimisation**: test checkout flow on mobile, ensure form fields (child name, animal, reading level) are easy to fill

### Pricing & packaging tests

- **Trial offer**: "First month for €19" (or "First month + tote bag for €29")
- **Prepaid plans**: 3-month (€79, save €8), 6-month (€149, save €25), 12-month (€279, save €69)
- **Gift subscriptions**: 3 or 6-month gift cards — critical for holiday season
- **Sibling discount**: 2nd child subscription at €22/mo
